# UCB-BIO-ENG-134-Final-Project

Description: Code that will extract information of a pH strip and output its pH. Also has a version for glucose.

Usage: The code in this repository is intended to be used in a raspberry PI. It is advised to ensure that the camera is able to completely capture both black boxes along with some white paper border. Try to get it as straight as possible. The pH box should be to the left.

template pH.docx: The sheet of paper to be printed out. The pH strip goes onto the skinnier box, and the reference goes into the fatter box.

Test.py: Outputs an image onto the raspberry PI, so the user can ensure that the camera and paper is positioned properly.

pH.py: Outputs the pH of the pH strip

pHNoReference.py: Outputs the pH of the pH strip without using a reference

glucose.py: Outputs the glucose level of the glucose strip
